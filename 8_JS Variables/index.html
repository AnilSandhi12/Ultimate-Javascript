                  * 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable: *

                            Using var
                            Using let
                            Using const
                            Using nothing

                     * What are Variables? *

        Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).


                           * When to Use JavaScript var? *

                    Always declare JavaScript variables with var,let, orconst.

                    The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

                    The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.

                    If you want your code to run in older browser, you must use var.


                      * When to Use JavaScript const? *

                If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const.

                If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.

                In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables:

                       * JavaScript Identifiers: *

                    All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names.

                    These unique names are called identifiers.

                    Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

                 *  The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: *

                    Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
                    Names must begin with a letter
                    Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
                    Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
                    Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

                    JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.

<script>
        // Three Variables in JS: Var,Let and Const
        // Using Var Keyword.
        var fname = " Anil ";
        var lname = " Sandhi ";
        document.write("My Name is:" + fname + lname + "<br>");
       
        //  Using let Keyword.
        let x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        let sum = x + y;
        document.write("Addition is:" + sum + "<br>");
        
        // undeclared Variables
        a = 40;
        b = 20;
        z = a / b;
        document.write("Division is :" + z + "<br>");

        const price1 = 212;
        const price2 = 12;
        let sub = price1 - price2;
        document.write("Our Origional Price is :" + sub + "rs" + "<br>");

        // Declaring a JavaScript Variable
           let carName = "Volvo";
           document.write("Car Name is :" + carName + "<br>"); 
           
        // Also Declare JS Variable 
        let movieName;
        movieName = "Chal Mera Putt";
        document.write("My Favourite Movie is :" + movieName + "<br>");    

        // One Statement, Many Variables
        let val1= 10; val2 = 20, val3 = 30, val4 = "Yatin Grover :)", add = val1 + val2 + val3;
        document.write("Our Output is : " + add + "<br>"); 
        document.write("My Name is : " + val4 + "<br>");

        // Value = undefined
        let  und;
        document.write(und + "<br>");

        //   Create Variable Using $ Sign
        var $ = " Valid ";
        var $$$$ = " Valid ";
        var $$myMoney = " Valid ";
        document.write("This is :" + $ + $$$$ + $$myMoney + "<br>");

        // Using Underscores:
        var _lname = "Sandhi";
        var _2 = 20;
        var _100 = 100;
        document.write("Our Output is :" + _lname + _2 + _100);
