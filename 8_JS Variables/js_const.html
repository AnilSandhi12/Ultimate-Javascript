    <h1>Const Keyword in JS</h1>
<!--
           * The const keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015). *
            Variables defined with const cannot be Redeclared.
            Variables defined with const cannot be Reassigned.
            Variables defined with const have Block Scope. 
-->
<!--
             * When to use JavaScript const?*

            As a general rule, always declare a variable with const unless you know that the value will change.

            Use const when you declare:
             A new Array
             A new Object
             A new Function
             A new RegExp
-->

<!--
                            Constant Objects and Arrays

                        The keyword const is a little misleading.

                        It does not define a constant value. It defines a constant reference to a value.

                        Because of this you can NOT:

                        Reassign a constant value
                        Reassign a constant array
                        Reassign a constant object
                        But you CAN:

                        Change the elements of constant array
                        Change the properties of constant object
