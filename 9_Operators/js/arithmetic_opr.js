                JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
                Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:

                Operator	                  Description
                  +	                            Addition
                  -    	                        Subtraction
                  *	                            Multiplication
                  **	                        Exponentiation (ES2016)
                  / 	                        Division
                  %	                            Modulus (Division Remainder)
                  ++	                        Increment
                  --	                        Decrement
